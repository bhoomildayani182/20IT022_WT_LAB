    ------> HTML is Not Case Sensitive

HTML Attributes

    ------>All HTML elements can have attributes
    ------>Attributes provide additional information about elements
    ------>Attributes are always specified in the start tag
    ------>Attributes  usually come in name/value pairs like: name="value"


    1. Absolute URL - Links to an external image that is hosted on another website. Example: src="https://www.w3schools.com/images/img_girl.jpg".

    Notes: External images might be under copyright. If you do not get permission to use it, you may be in violation of copyright laws. In addition, you cannot control external images; it can suddenly be removed or changed.

    2. Relative URL - Links to an image that is hosted within the website. Here, the URL does not include the domain name. If the URL begins without a slash, it will be relative to the current page. Example: src="img_girl.jpg". If the URL begins with a slash, it will be relative to the domain. Example: src="/images/img_girl.jpg".

    Tip: It is almost always best to use relative URLs. They will not break if you change domain.

Chapter Summary

    All HTML elements can have attributes
    The href attribute of <a> specifies the URL of the page the link goes to
    The src attribute of <img> specifies the path to the image to be displayed
    The width and height attributes of <img> provide size information for images
    The alt attribute of <img> provides an alternate text for an image
    The style attribute is used to add styles to an element, such as color, font, size, and more
    The lang attribute of the <html> tag declares the language of the Web page
    The title attribute defines some extra information about an element

HTML Headings
    HTML headings are defined with the to tags.

<h1> defines the most important heading. </h1> defines the least important heading.

Bigger Headings
    Each HTML heading has a default size. However, you can specify the size for any heading with the style attribute, using the CSS font-size property:
    
HTML Paragraphs
    The HTML <p> element defines a paragraph.
    
    A paragraph always starts on az new line, and browsers automatically add some white space (a margin) before and after a paragraph.

HTML Display
    You cannot be sure how HTML will be displayed.
    
    Large or small screens, and resized windows will create different results.
    
    With HTML, you cannot change the display by adding extra spaces or extra lines in your HTML code.
    
    The browser will automatically remove any extra spaces and lines when the page is displayed:

ex:

<p>
    This paragraph
    contains a lot of lines
    in the source code,
    but the browser
    ignores it.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    This paragraph
    contains         a lot of spaces
    in the source         code,
    but the        browser
    ignores it.
    </p>

HTML Horizontal Rules
    The <hr> tag defines a thematic break in an HTML page, and is most often displayed as a horizontal rule.
    
    The <hr> element is used to separate content (or define a change) in an HTML page:

HTML Line Breaks
    The HTML <br> element defines a line break.
    
    Use <br> if you want a line break (a new line) without starting a new paragraph:

The HTML <pre> Element
        The HTML <pre> element defines preformatted text.
        
        The text inside a <pre> element is displayed in a fixed-width font (usually Courier), and it preserves both spaces and line breaks:
        
Example
        <pre>
          My Bonnie lies over the ocean.
        
          My Bonnie lies over the sea.
        
          My Bonnie lies over the ocean.
        
          Oh, bring back my Bonnie to me.
        </pre>

The HTML Style Attribute
        Setting the style of an HTML element, can be done with the style attribute.
        
        The HTML style attribute has the following syntax:
        
        <tagname style="property:value;">


Background Color
         The CSS background-color property defines the background color for an HTML element.
            
 Example
         Set the background color for a page to powderblue:
            
        <body style="background-color:powderblue;">
            
        <h1>This is a heading</h1>
        <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
          
Text Alignment
        The CSS text-align property defines the horizontal text alignment for an HTML element:
        
Example
        <h1 style="text-align:center;">Centered Heading</h1>
        <p style="text-align:center;">Centered paragraph.</p>    
        
Chapter Summary

        Use the style attribute for styling HTML elements
        Use background-color for background color
        Use color for text colors
        Use font-family for text fonts
        Use font-size for text sizes
        Use text-align for text alignment

HTML Formatting Elements
Formatting elements were designed to display special types of text:
        
        <b> - Bold text
        <strong> - Important text
        <i> - Italic text
        <em> - Emphasized text
        <mark> - Marked text
        <small> - Smaller text
        <del> - Deleted text
        <ins> - Inserted text
        <sub> - Subscript text
        <sup> - Superscript text

HTML <blockquote> for Quotations
        The HTML <blockquote> element defines a section that is quoted from another source.
                
        Browsers usually indent <blockquote> elements.
    Example
            <p>Here is a quote from WWF's website:</p>
            <blockquote cite="http://www.worldwildlife.org/who/index.html">
            For 50 years, WWF has been protecting the future of nature.
            The world's leading conservation organization,
            WWF works in 100 countries and is supported by
            1.2 million members in the United States and
            close to 5 million globally.
            </blockquote>
        
HTML <q> for Short Quotations
     The HTML <q> tag defines a short quotation.
                
     Browsers normally insert quotation marks around the quotation.

HTML <abbr> for Abbreviations
        The HTML <abbr> tag defines an abbreviation or an acronym, like "HTML", "CSS", "Mr.", "Dr.", "ASAP", "ATM".
        
        Marking abbreviations can give useful information to browsers, translation systems and search-engines.
        
        Tip: Use the global title attribute to show the description for the abbreviation/acronym when you mouse over the element. 
        
Example
    <p>The <abbr title="World Health Organization">WHO</abbr> was founded in 1948.</p>    
    
HTML <address> for Contact Information
        The HTML <address> tag defines the contact information for the author/owner of a document or an article.
        
        The contact information can be an email address, URL, physical address, phone number, social media handle, etc.
        
        The text in the <address> element usually renders in italic, and browsers will always add a line break before and after the <address> element.
        
Example
        <address>
        Written by John Doe.<br>
        Visit us at:<br>
        Example.com<br>
        Box 564, Disneyland<br>
        USA
        </address>

HTML <cite> for Work Title
            The HTML <cite> tag defines the title of a creative work (e.g. a book, a poem, a song, a movie, a painting, a sculpture, etc.).
            
            Note: A person's name is not the title of a work.
            
            The text in the <cite> element usually renders in italic.

HTML <bdo> for Bi-Directional Override
        BDO stands for Bi-Directional Override.
                    
        The HTML <bdo> tag is used to override the current text direction:


HTML Comment Tag
        You can add comments to your HTML source by using the following syntax:
            
        <!-- Write your comments here -->


Border Color
<h1 style="border:2px solid Tomato;">Hello World</h1>
<h1 style="border:2px solid DodgerBlue;">Hello World</h1>
<h1 style="border:2px solid Violet;">Hello World</h1>

Color Values
    In HTML, colors can also be specified using RGB values, HEX values, HSL values, RGBA values, and HSLA values.

    The following three <div> elements have their background color set with RGB, HEX, and HSL values:

    rgb(255, 99, 71)
    #ff6347
    hsl(9, 100%, 64%)
    The following two <div> elements have their background color set with RGBA and HSLA values, which adds an Alpha channel to the color (here we have 50% transparency):
  
RGB Color Values
        In HTML, a color can be specified as an RGB value, using this formula:
        
        rgb(red, green, blue)
        RGBA Color Values
        RGBA color values are an extension of RGB color values with an Alpha channel - which specifies the opacity for a color.
        
An RGBA color value is specified with:
        
        rgba(red, green, blue, alpha)
        
        The alpha parameter is a number between 0.0 (fully transparent) and 1.0 (not transparent at all):

HTML Links - The target Attribute
By default, the linked page will be displayed in the current browser window. To change this, you must specify another target for the link.

The target attribute specifies where to open the linked document.

The target attribute can have one of the following values:

_self - Default. Opens the document in the same window/tab as it was clicked
_blank - Opens the document in a new window or tab
_parent - Opens the document in the parent frame
_top - Opens the document in the full body of the window

Link to an Email Address
Use mailto: inside the href attribute to create a link that opens the user's email program (to let them send a new email):

Example
<a href="mailto:someone@example.com">Send email</a>
   
----------------------------------------------------------
Button as a Link
To use an HTML button as a link, you have to add some JavaScript code.

JavaScript allows you to specify what happens at certain events, such as a click of a button:

Example
<button onclick="document.location='default.asp'">HTML Tutorial</button>
-------------------------------------------------------
Chapter Summary
